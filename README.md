<i>Introduction:</i>
Bones are able to adapt to their environment by growing when over-stressed and decaying in cross-section when under-stressed. Thanks to this ability, the bones are a near-optimum structure tailored to the specific external loading. The aim of the research project is to apply this principal of optimisation to steel framed structures in order to achieve a custom cross-section, tailored for the loading the beam is under.
